## What's New?
* Added "CFZ Cudnn Toggle" node, it is for some of the audio models, not working with cudnn -which is enabled by default on new install method- to use it just connect it before ksampler -latent_image input or any latent input- disable cudnn, THEN after the vae decoding -which most of these problems occur- to re-enable cudnn , add it after vae-decoding, select audio_output and connect it save audio node of course enable cudnn now.This way within that workflow you are disabling cudnn when working with models that are not compatible with it, so instead of completely disabling it in comfy we can do it locally like this.  
* Added an experiment of mine, "CFZ Checkpoint Loader", a very basic quantizer for models. It only works -reliably- with SDXL and variants aka noobai or illustrious etc. It only works on the unet aka main model so no clips or vae. BUT it gives around %23 to %29 less vram usage with sdxl models. The generation time slows around 5 to 10 percent at most. This is especially good for low vram folks, 6GB - 8GB it could even be helpful for 4GB I don't know. Feel free to copy- modify- improve it, and try it with nvidia gpu's as well. Of course this fork is AMD only but you can take it and try it anywhere. Just you know I am not actively working on it, and besides SDXL cannot guarantee any vram improvements let alone a working node :) NOTE: It doesn't need any special packages or hardware so it probably would work with any gpu. Again, don't ask me to add x etc.
* BOTH of these nodes are inside "cfz" folder, to use them copy them into custom_nodes, they would appear next time you open comfy, to find them searh for "cfz" you will see both nodes.
* flash-attention download error fixed, also added sage-attention fix, especially for vae out of memory errors that occurs a lot with sage-attention enabled. NOTE : this doesn't require any special packages or hardware as far as I know so it could work with everything.
* `install-n.bat` now not only installs everything needed for MIOPEN and Flash-Attention use, it also automates installing triton (only supported for python 3.10.x and 3.11.x) and flash-attention. So if you especially have 6000+ gpu , have HIP 6.2.4 and libraries if necessary, try it. But beware, there are lots of errors yet to be unsolved. So it is still not the default installed version.
* If you want to enable MIOPEN , Triton and Flash-Attention use the install-n.bat . This will install torch 2.7 , with latest nightly zluda and patch the correct files into comfyui-zluda. This features do not work very well and you are on your own if you want to try these. (---- You have to install HIP 6.2.4 - Download and extract HIP Addon inside the folder (information down below on installation section). ---)
* Florance2 is now fixed , (probably some other nodes too) you need to disable "do_sample" meaning change it from True to False, now it would work without needing to edit it's node.
* Added onnxruntime fix so that it now uses cpu-only regardless of node. So now  nodes like pulid, reactor, infiniteyou etc works without problems and can now use codeformer too.
* Added a way to use any zluda you want (to use with HIP versions you want to use such as 6.1 - 6.2) After installing, close the app, run `patchzluda2.bat`. It will ask for url of the zluda build you want to use. You can choose from them here,
 [lshyqqtiger's ZLUDA Fork](https://github.com/lshqqytiger/ZLUDA/releases) then you can use `patchzluda2.bat`, run it paste the link via right click (A correct link would be like this, `https://github.com/lshqqytiger/ZLUDA/releases/download/rel.d60bddbc870827566b3d2d417e00e1d2d8acc026/ZLUDA-windows-rocm6-amd64.zip`)
 After pasting press enter and it would patch that zluda into comfy for you.

* Reverted zluda version back to 3.8.4. After updating try running patchzluda and if still have problems, delete venv and re-run install.bat.

* Added a "small flux guide." This aims to use low vram and provides the very basic necessary files needed to get flux generation running. [HERE](fluxguide.md)
* Added --reserve-vram with the value of 0.9 to commandline options that run with the app on startup. Greatly helps reduce using too much memory on generations.
* Changed `start.bat` to `comfyui.bat` because there is already a windows command by that name, which
  creates some problems. Also added  `fix-update.bat` which solves the problem that causes not being able to
  update to the latest version.

## Dependencies

If coming from the very start, you need :

1. **Git**: Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win.
   During installation don't forget to check the box for "Use Git from the Windows Command line and also from
   3rd-party-software" to add Git to your system's PATH.
2. **Python** ([3.10.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe) 3.11 also works, but 3.10 is used by most popular nodes atm): Install the latest release from python.org. **Don't Use
   Windows Store Version**. If you have that installed, uninstall and please install from python.org. During
   installation remember to check the box for "Add Python to PATH when you are at the "Customize Python" screen.
3. **Visual C++ Runtime**: Download [vc_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) and install it.
4. Install **HIP SDK 5.7.1** from [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html) the correct version, "Windows 10 & 11 5.7.1 HIP SDK"

   *** (*** this app installs zluda for 5.7.1 by default, if you want to use 6.1 or 6.2 you have to get the latest zluda link from
    [lshyqqtiger's ZLUDA Fork](https://github.com/lshqqytiger/ZLUDA/releases) then you can use `patchzluda2.bat`, run it paste the link via right click (a correct link would be like this, 
    `https://github.com/lshqqytiger/ZLUDA/releases/download/rel.d60bddbc870827566b3d2d417e00e1d2d8acc026/ZLUDA-windows-rocm6-amd64.zip` press enter and it would patch that zluda into comfy for you. Of course this also would mean you have to change the variables below 
     from "5.7" to "6.x" where needed) ***

5. Add the system variable HIP_PATH, value: `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\` (This is the default folder with default 5.7.1 installed, if you
   have installed it on another drive, change if necessary, if you have installed 6.2.4, or other newer versions the numbers should reflect that.)
    1. Check the variables on the lower part (System Variables), there should be a variable called: HIP_PATH.
    2. Also check the variables on the lower part (System Variables), there should be a variable called: "Path".
       Double-click it and click "New" add this: `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin` (This is the default folder with default 5.7.1 installed, if you
   have installed it on another drive, change if necessary, if you have installed 6.2.4, or other newer versions the numbers should reflect that.)

    ((( these should be  HIP_PATH, value: `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\6.2\` and Path variable  `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\6.2\bin` )))

   5.1  *** YOU MUST DO THIS ADDITIONAL STEP : if you want to try miopen-triton with high end gpu : ***
   
    * Install **HIP SDK 6.2.4** from [HERE](https://www.amd.com/en/developer/resources/rocm-hub/hip-sdk.html) the correct version, "Windows 10 & 11 6.2.4 HIP SDK"
    * Then download hip sdk addon from one of these urls and extract that into `C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\6.2` .
    *  [Link-1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/qhct48vamgmn0tv/HIP-SDK-extension-full.zip/file)      [Link-2](https://gofile.io/d/kUXwYu)

7. If you have an AMD GPU below 6800 (6700,6600 etc.), download the recommended library files for your gpu

- from [Brknsoul Repository](https://github.com/brknsoul/ROCmLibs) (for hip 5.7.1)

- from [likelovewant Repository](https://github.com/likelovewant/ROCmLibs-for-gfx1103-AMD780M-APU/releases/tag/v0.6.2.4) (for hip 6.2.4)

    1. Go to folder "C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas", (or 6.2 if you have installed that) there would be a "library" folder, backup the files
       inside to somewhere else.
    2. Open your downloaded optimized library archive and put them inside the library folder (overwriting if
       necessary): "C:\\Program Files\\AMD\\ROCm\\5.7\\bin\\rocblas\\library" (or 6.2 if you have installed that)
       * There could be a rocblas.dll file in the archive as well, if it is present then copy it inside "C:\Program Files\AMD\ROCm\5.7\bin\rocblas" (or 6.2 if you have installed that)
7. Reboot your system.

## Setup (Windows-Only)

Open a cmd prompt. (Powershell doesn't work, you have to use command prompt.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patientx/ComfyUI-Zluda
```

```bash
cd ComfyUI-Zluda
```

```bash
install.bat
```
((( use `install-n.bat` if you want to install for miopen-triton combo for high end gpu's )))

to start for later use (or create a shortcut to) :

```bash
comfyui.bat
```
((( use `comfyui-n.bat` if you want to use miopen-triton combo for high end gpu's, that basically changes the attention to pytorch attention which works with flash attention )))

    --- To use sage-attention , you have to change the "--use-pytorch-cross-attention" to "--use-sage-attention". My advice is make a seperate batch file for all different attention types instead of changing them.
    --- You can use "--use-pytorch-cross-attention", "--use-quad-cross-attention" , "--use-flash-attention" and "--use-sage-attention" . Also you can activate flash or sage with the help some nodes from pytorch attention.

also for later when you need to repatch zluda (maybe a torch update etc.) you can use:

```bash
patchzluda.bat
```

((( `patchzluda-n.bat` for miopen-triton setup)))

- The first generation would take around 10-15 minutes, there won't be any progress or indicator on the webui or cmd
  window, just wait. Zluda creates a database for use with generation with your gpu.

> [!NOTE]
> **This might happen with torch changes , zluda version changes and / or gpu driver changes.**

## Troubleshooting

- `CUDA device detected: None` , if seeing this error with the new install-n , make sure you are NOT using the amd driver 25.5.1 . Use a previous driver, it has problems with zluda.
- `RuntimeError: CUDNN_BACKEND_OPERATIONGRAPH_DESCRIPTOR: cudnnFinalize FailedmiopenStatusInternalError cudnn_status: miopenStatusUnknownError` , if this is encountered at the end, while vae-decoding, use tiled-vae decoding either from official comfy nodes or from Tiled-Diffussion (my preference). Also vae-decoding is overall better with tiled-vae decoding. 
- If you installed miopen-triton setup with install.n.bat , getting ":: Triton core imported successfully , :: Running Triton kernel test... , :: Triton test failed , :: Triton available but failed verification" Do this to fix it :
   * Copy "libs" folder from python install directory under(C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310) Or 311 , whatever python you are using, to under "comfyui-zluda\venv" so ,
   * For example : "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\libs" to "d:\Comfyui-Zluda\venv\* Beware, there are two similar folders under venv , "Lib" and "Library" , so this would be a similarly named folder , don't mistake them.
  Then try running comfy again.
- DO NOT use non-english characters as folder names to put comfyui-zluda under.
- Wipe your pip cache "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\pip\cache" You can also do this when venv is active with :
  `pip cache purge`
- `xformers` isn't usable with zluda so any nodes / packages that require it doesn't work. `Flash attention`
  doesn't work.
- Have the latest drivers installed for your amd gpu. **Also, Remove Any Nvidia Drivers** you might have from previous
  nvidia gpu's.
- If you see zluda errors make sure these three files are inside "ComfyUI-Zluda\venv\Lib\site-packages\torch\lib\"
  `cublas64_11.dll (231kb)` `cusparse64_11.dll (199kb)` `nvrtc64_112_0.dll (129kb)` If they are there but much bigger in size please run : `patchzluda.bat` (this is for zluda 3.8.4, other versions might be different sizes)
- If for some reason you can't solve with these and want to start from zero, delete "venv" folder and re-run
  `install.bat`
- If you can't git pull to the latest version, run these commands, `git fetch --all` and then
  `git reset --hard origin/master` now you can git pull
- Problems with `caffe2_nvrtc.dll`: if you are sure you properly installed hip and can see it on path, please DON'T use
  python from windows store, use the link provided or 3.11 from the official website. After uninstalling python from
  windows store and installing the one from the website, be sure the delete venv folder, and run install.bat once again.
- `rocBLAS`-error: If you have an integrated GPU by AMD (e.g. AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics) you need to add `HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` to your
  environment variables. Other possible variables to use : `ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1` `HCC_AMDGPU_TARGET=1` . This basically tells it to use 1st gpu -this number could be different if you have multiple gpu's-
  Otherwise it will default to using your iGPU, which will most likely not work. This behavior is caused by a bug in the ROCm-driver.
- Lots of other problems were encountered and solved by users so check the issues if you can't find your problem here.
